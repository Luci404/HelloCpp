# Data types
## Primary data types
 - Integer: A number which is not a fraction.
    - int8_t: -128 - 128
    - int16_t -32768 - 32768
    - int32_t (int):-2147483648 - 2147483648
    - int64_t -9223372036854775808 - 9223372036854775808
    - uint8_t (byte): 0-256
    - uint16_t: 0-65536
    - uint32_t: 0-4294967296
    - uint64_t: 0-18446744073709551616
 - Character: Singular character
   - char: Same as uint8_t, interpreted differently by some functions. 
 - Boolean:
   - bool: Same as uint8_t, interpreted differently by some functions.
 - Floating point: Fractions.
   - float: 4 bytes, accuracy 7 decimal digit
   - double: 8 bytes, accuracy 16 decimal digit
 - Valueless:
   - Void
 - Array:
   - Array[]: Statically defined list, meaning that the number of elements are defined upon creations.
 - String
  - std::string: literally just text... 

## Abstract data types: user-defined (Stuff that we help define in our code).
 - List:
   - vector: Dynamic list, meaning that the number of elements are not statically defined. 
 - Structure: Data structure
   - struct
 - Class: Data structure but more features
   - class
 
# Loops
# for loop
 - Loop over a list

# while loop
 - repeat until condition returns false
